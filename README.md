# BridgeOfficer
This program checks the weight of the truck using console input and returns the result: whether the truck can pass or not.
In the class Check, the method "check" uses the constructor of the BridgeOfficer class to set a value against 
which the weight of the truck will be compared. 
Based on this comparison, the result will be displayed in the console "You can go!" or "You can't go here. Your truck is overweight."
If a non-integer value is entered into the console, we get the output: "Incorrect value."
The program uses an infinite loop, and in order to end it, you must enter the word "STOP" in the console
